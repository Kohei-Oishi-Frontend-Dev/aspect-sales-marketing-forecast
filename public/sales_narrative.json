  "narrative": "August 2025 sales reached £1.99 m, an 11.8% drop versus July and a 31.3% YoY decline (YTD £16.89 m vs £24.60 m). The absence of any forecast output indicates the predictive model was not operational for the 23 Aug‑22 Sep window, leaving next‑month revenue uncertain. The steep MoM and YoY falls suggest weakened demand, likely from seasonal slowdown and reduced market share. Immediate actions: activate a reliable forecasting tool, launch targeted promotions to recover lost volume, and conduct a pricing‑margin review to protect profitability while the model is reinstated.",
